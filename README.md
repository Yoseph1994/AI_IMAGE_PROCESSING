# Virtual Mouse - Made with Python, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, and MediaPipe

## Description
Welcome to the repository for my Virtual Mouse project! This project utilizes the power of Python, PyAutoGUI, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to enable users to control their computers using hand gestures. With the help of the MediaPipe library, the program can recognize hand landmarks and translate them into mouse movements and clicks.

## Features
- Hand gesture recognition for controlling the mouse pointer.
- Real-time translation of hand landmarks into cursor movement.
- Customizable sensitivity and responsiveness for precise control.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python  3.x on your machine.
- You have installed the required libraries: `mediapipe`, `pyautogui`, and `opencv-python`.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
bash pip install mediapipe pyautogui opencv-python


## Usage
To use the Virtual Mouse, simply clone the repository and run the main script file. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal to start controlling your mouse with hand gestures.
